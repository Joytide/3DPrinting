# Summary

The model was altered to support the Solderless USB Zero Addon 1.1 Board for the Raspberry Pi Zero (W) to use as a USB Gadget.  Multiple variations were made off of this with various header positions.  Space and posts are also available for the Mini MFRC 522 RFID Reader/Writer P/N 0006. 

From the original top design, the USB and HDMI width was slightly increased.

## Assembly Notes

M2.5x10mm Screws are NOT included with the addon board and will need to be purchased separately.

1. Tap the holes on the top, using one of your screws.
2. Poke the hole for the LED
3. Snap the Addon Board into the bottom. 
4. Put the screws through the holes on the bottom 
5. put the nuts on the screws going through the addon board
6. it is important you put the Raspberry Pi on the screws at this point
7. Rest the top on the screws and screw in the top evenly, rotating and screwing a few times on each.  If the Pi is seated uneven the contacts may not be made and you may need to try again.
